### Create the feed record in the CMS

If you have permission to access the Curator.io section of your website's CMS, you will see a Curator.io entry in the left menu. If you do not have permission, ask someone who does.

In this section, hit the button "Add Curator.io feed" and enter the following values

1. A title of your feed
1. A description of your feed
1. The Feed Public Key (from the Curator website, as above)
1. The Container ID (from the Curator website, as above)

Save.

### Create the element in the CMS

1. On the relevant page, choose `Add Block`
1. Select the `Curator.io feed widget` and open the resulting element
1. Select a Curator.io feed in the drop down menu provided
1. To preview your changes, save the element in the CMS
1. Optionally publish the CMS element when ready

You can link multiple content blocks to the same feed record across multiple pages.

After completing these steps, the feed will display in the relevant website page.
